          <h1>Garry Kasparov</h1>
          <p>Garry Kasparov, the 13th world chess champion, held the title from 1985 to 2000. He first rose to number one in the world rankings in 1984 and remained the world's top chess player until 2006. He dominated chess for over 20 years . On March 3, 2000, Kasparov reached his all-time rating of 2856 points, a record surpassed only by Carlsen.<br/>
            In 2000, Kramnik defeated Kasparov, taking the title from the greatest chess player of all time. Kasparov continued to compete in tournaments until his retirement in 2005, when he was still ranked number one in the world. And after that, Kasparov did not completely leave the world of chess. he competed in exhibition matches and coached Carlsen and Hikaru Nakamura . His five-volume "My Great Predecessors" is one of the greatest books in the history of chess.

          <h1>Magnus Carlsen</h1>
          <p>Magnus Carlsen - spent more than 10 years on the chess throne from 2013 to 2023. In 2009, he became the youngest 800 player in the history of chess, and on April 21, 2014, he scored the historically highest rating of 2889 Elo points.<br/>
            Carlsen said in an interview in January 2020: “Kasparov was the strongest in the world for 20 years without a break... He should be considered the No. 1 chess player in history. But I feel that time is in my favor... I am not yet 30 years old. If you count who has achieved what by the age of 30, then I’m ahead.”

          <h1>Robert Fisher</h1>
          <p>Robert Fischer is the 11th world chess champion and the only American to win the title. For many, he is the most famous chess player in history. In 1970-1971, Fischer won 20 games in a row against world-class opponents, something no one had achieved before or after him. This achievement is considered one of the seven most amazing chess records.<br/>
            His style was original and creative. He attacked and defended equally well, displaying frightening positional awareness. Fischer inspired many generations of chess players in the United States and around the world. The “Game of the Century” he won is one of the most famous games of all time, and the book “My 60 Memorable Games” is one of the best in the history of chess.

          <h1>Jose Raul</h1>
          <p>Jose Raul Capablanca is the third world chess champion and one of the most gifted chess players in history. From 1916 to 1924, his streak of 40 wins and 23 draws without defeats continued - an unprecedented historical achievement. During these years, Capablanca's talent and skill were unrivaled.<br/>
            Capablanca became world champion after defeating the legendary Lasker in 1921. Many believe that he became stronger than Lasker much earlier and could have defeated Alekhine in a rematch, but Capablanca's championship term was shortened by the First World War and disputes about holding world championship matches. Every world champion mastered all stages of a chess game perfectly, but Capablanca was especially good at endings. Even now with engines it is difficult to find errors in his classic games.

          <h1>Anatoly Karpov</h1>
          <p>Anatoly Karpov, the 12th world champion, held the chess crown from 1975 to 1985, and from 1993 to 1999 was the FIDE world champion. Karpov was an exceptionally versatile chess player, but the main features of his style are called positional control, preventive play and excellent endgame technique.<br/>
            When Kasparov broke with FIDE in 1993, Karpov won a match under the auspices of this organization, Jan Timman, in 1996 he defended his title in a match with Gata Kamsky and in 1998 with Anand. In 1999, FIDE decided to play for the champion title in a knockout tournament, but Karpov refused to play under such conditions. Karpov's creativity remains a source of inspiration for all positional chess players today. A collection of his best games is one of the greatest books in the history of chess.

          <h1>Mikhail Botvinnik</h1>
          <p>Mikhail Botvinnik is known as the "patriarch of the Soviet chess school." The sixth world champion held the title from 1948 to 1963 (with two short breaks), remaining one of the strongest grandmasters in the world for more than 30 years. Botvinnik's style was characterized by a combination of iron logic and flexibility, and he also had a special gift for methodical preparation and strategic planning. He could adapt to any opponent's playing style. Botvinnik became world champion in 1948.<br/>
            His era on the chess throne ended with a match against Petrosian in 1963, but Botvinnik continued to play at the highest level until his tournament career ended in 1970. Back in 1963, the first session of the All-Union Chess School of Botvinnik, who participated in the formation of three world champions: Karpov, Kasparov and Kramnik, took place.

        <div class="content__txt">
          <h1>Vladimir Kramnyk</h1>
          <p>Vladimir Kramnik was world champion from 2000 to 2007. He defeated the legendary Kasparov in 2000 and defended his title against Peter Leko in 2004 and Veselin Topalov in 2006. By defeating FIDE world champion Topalov in a unification match, Kramnik became the first undisputed world champion since Kasparov's break with FIDE in 1993.<br/>
            In his best years, Kramnik could do anything in chess. He is particularly renowned for his fantastic finishing skills and pure positional style. Kramnik is one of the most unassailable defenders in the history of chess. For 25 years in a row, Kramnik was among the top ten strongest grandmasters in the world, until he announced his retirement from professional chess in January 2019.

          <h1>Emanuel Lasker</h1>
          <p>Emanuel Lasker was the second world chess champion. He held the title for 27 years, from 1894 to 1921, longer than anyone else. His playing career lasted fifty years. Lasker won the title against the first world champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, in 1894, and defended it five times against top contenders: Frank Marshall, Siegbert Tarrasch, David Janowski and Karl Schlechter.<br/>
            In 1921, Lasker lost the world championship match to Capablanca, but continued to achieve success at the highest level. In 1935, at the age of 66, he took third place in a tournament in Moscow, half a point behind Botvinnik and Salo Flora, but ahead of Capablanca and 16 other participants.

          <h1>Mikhail Tal</h1>
          <p>Mikhail Tal, the "Wizard from Riga", was the eighth official world champion. He defeated Botvinnik in 1960 to win the title at 23, becoming the youngest world champion, although Kasparov and Carlsen would later surpass this achievement.<br/>
            Tal's unique attacking style has been inspiring chess players for many decades. He famously said: “You need to drag the enemy into a dark, dense forest, where 2 + 2 = 5, and the saving path is narrow enough for only you to walk along it.” Tal's collection of games, Into the Fire of Attack, is considered one of the greatest chess books of all time.

          <h1>Alexander Alekhine</h1>
          <p>Alexander Alekhine is the fourth world chess champion, occupying the Caissa throne from 1927 to 1946 (except for the period 1935-1937). He was a brilliant, versatile chess player with a special ability to play combinations in difficult positions. From him the chess world learned that rules and principles can be violated if the peculiarities of a particular position require it. Alekhine defeated Jose Raul Capablanca in the world championship match in 1927, although he had not won a single game against him before.<br/>
            Alekhine's reign as world champion was long, but he successfully defended the title only twice, against Efim Bogolyubov in 1929 and 1934. For many reasons, Capablanca and Alekhine never played a rematch. In 1935, Alekhine unexpectedly lost in the world championship match to Max Euwe, but two years later he won in a rematch and regained the crown, which he retained until his death. In 1946, he died as a world champion, having already agreed on a championship match with Botvinnik.

          <p>Viswanathan Anand is the FIDE World Champion from 2000 to 2002 and the 15th recognized World Champion from 2007 to 2013. He began competing for the world championship back in 1995, losing to Garry Kasparov in a match for the Professional Chess Association (PCA) title. In 2007, Anand beat Vladimir Kramnik and other world-class chess players in a two-round tournament where the title of world champion was played, receiving the title of champion. In 2008, he defeated Kramnik in a match, becoming the 15th universally recognized world champion. In 2010, he defended his title against Veselin Topalov, and in 2012 against Boris Gelfand. In 2013, Anand lost in a match to the current world champion Magnus Carlsen.<br/>
            Anand is India's strongest grandmaster of all time, having inspired many generations of chess players in his homeland and around the world.

          <h1>Paul Morphy</h1>
          <p>Paul Morphy is a symbol of attacking, romantic chess, the strongest chess player of the 1850s, and indeed the entire 19th century. In his time, the world title did not exist, but he was light years ahead of his contemporaries and was recognized as the unofficial world champion.<br/>
            In 1857, Morphy won the American Chess Congress, and in 1858 he traveled to Europe to defeat the world's leading chess players in matches. Morphy introduced the world of chess to sacrificial combinations and the importance of development, the accuracy of counting variations and new attack techniques. His role in the Opera - one of the most famous roles of all time - remains attractive to this day.
